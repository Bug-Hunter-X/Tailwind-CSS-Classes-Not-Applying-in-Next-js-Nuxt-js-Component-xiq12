# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in Next.js/Nuxt.js Component

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply correctly within a Next.js or Nuxt.js component. The bug.js file shows an example component with missing Tailwind styles, while the bugSolution.js file provides a corrected implementation.

## Problem

When using Tailwind CSS in Next.js or Nuxt.js projects, sometimes utility classes don't get applied to components as expected. This can be due to various reasons, including incorrect configuration or component structure. The bug.js file illustrates a component where Tailwind classes do not work as expected.

## Solution

The bugSolution.js file demonstrates the correct implementation.  This solution might involve checking the Tailwind configuration (tailwind.config.js), ensuring the proper import statements are used for the CSS, and verifying that the component is structured to allow Tailwind's purge process to function properly.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the development server (Next.js: `npm run dev`; Nuxt.js: `npm run dev`).
