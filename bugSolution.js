The solution often involves ensuring proper configuration in `tailwind.config.js` and correctly importing Tailwind's CSS. It also may require restructuring your component to ensure Tailwind's purge mechanism correctly includes it.

```javascript
// Correct component structure (bugSolution.js)
import tw from 'tailwind-css-classnames'; // or other method to import Tailwind classes

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className={tw`bg-red-500 p-4`}>
      <h1>This is a component</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Ensure correct Tailwind Configuration:**

Verify your `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure it is correctly configured and includes your content path.

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

**Proper CSS Import (Example for Next.js):**

In your `pages/_app.js` or equivalent:

```javascript
import '../styles/globals.css'
```

Import the CSS file generated by Tailwind after building your styles.

This solution addresses the core problem of ensuring the classes are correctly recognized and applied by Tailwind's build process.  Remember to adjust imports and file names according to your project setup.
